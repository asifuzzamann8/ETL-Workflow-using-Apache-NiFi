# ETL Workflow using Apache NiFi
The project is developed with open source big data tools from Apache. All the required tools are installed and configured from scratch in a Linux environment to explore the mechanism of the Apache Big Data ecosystem.

All the supporting tutorials are provided so that this document can be used as a development manual. Also, the technical challenges during the development process and their solution are described or highlighted in the sections. In addition, all the required configuration and coding files are attached to the project folder. Also, important code and configuration steps are mentioned in the glossary.
